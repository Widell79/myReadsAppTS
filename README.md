# My BookShelf App

## Overview

**This app is not finalized!**

My goal was to learn more about the use of TypeScript with RN.

The app has been built and tested for Android devices.

The "homescreen" is a bookshelf with the following shelfs:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

There is an initial React book in the Currently Reading shelf :D

There is a add button to open up a search view and search books from the **Google Books API**

The user can click on a book image in search view or in the bookshelf to get more information on the book and also change the shelf or add it to a shelf if in search view.

## ToDo

My plan is to add the Async Storage functionality to the app.

## Instructions

Install project dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`

Start the project with one of the following commands,  
`yarn start`  
`expo start`  
`npm start`

To run on an Android device, download the Expo Go app and scan the QR code that shows up when starting the project.

## Stack

The project uses: [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org//), [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), [Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/).
